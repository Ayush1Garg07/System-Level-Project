This repository contains C/C++ implementations of various CPU scheduling algorithms used in Operating Systems:

- First-Come First-Serve (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Priority Scheduling
- Round Robin (RR)
- Multilevel Queue Scheduling (MLFQ)

## How to Run

Each folder contains a standalone `.cpp` file. You can compile and run using any C++ compiler:
